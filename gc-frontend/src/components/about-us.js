                <h4>Who we are: </h4>
                <p>
                    We are a small, but growing, community of gamers of varying backgrounds who share similar ideas
                    and levels of passion for gaming as a whole. We play a wide variety of games, including Pokemon, 
                    Mario Kart, Minecraft, Space Engineers, Iron Harvest, and Super Smash Bros. just to name a few. 
                    For those of us with a competitive spirit, we also host tournaments around the games we play and
                    give prizes to our top competitors every so often. Finally, when we're not doing either of those two
                    things, we hang out and discuss gaming topics and dank memes. But as much of an amazing community
                    as we are, we didn't just appear out of nowhere.
                    <br />
                    "So how did you guys start"? you might ask. As the author of this section, I don't know much of
                    our origin, but I can tell you how I first became a member. It was a day like any other at 
                    Granger High School. I had classes to take, work to do, and house affairs to take of in between.
                    Then, as I was walking across the school's hallway, I noticed a flyer for a gaming tournament.
                    As I saw that flyer, a flurry of thoughts rushed into my head. "A gaming tournament? In a school?!"
                    To me, that was unheard of. Just the thought alone filled me with excitement! So without
                    hesitation, I attended the tournament. As expected, I did poorly. Of course, my own performance
                    didn't matter, because the energy of the room and seeing everyone else perform their
                    best was enough for me to keep attending the club meetings. And the very next school year, 
                    I did just that. During our regular meetings, we would play games and mingle with other 
                    gamers. Once per quarter, we would also host tournaments to see which of us, as well as a few 
                    other students not part of the club, would be number one. Essentially, we did much of the same
                    things we still do today. We didn't go without our dark times, though. After game club founder, 
                    Anthony Illif, and host (a.k.a, Granger's AP Chemistry teacher), Mr. Quist, left the school, many
                    of us disbanded from the club and it became much more difficult to hold our regular meetings.
                    Thankfully, the few that still saw hope that the club would live on (myself included), stayed
                    with the club and sought to rebuild it, even after it dissolved from the school. Today, we are
                    20+ members strong and still share the same passion for gaming, as well as the community, as we did
                    since the beginning!
